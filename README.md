KiCad Mac Builder
=================

If you are looking to run KiCad on your Mac, please use the instructions at http://kicad.org/download/osx/.

If you are looking to compile KiCad or improve KiCad packaging on macOS, kicad-mac-builder may be able to help you.

To build KiCad 5.1, use the 5.1 branch of this repository.

Setup
=====
kicad-mac-builder requires a Mac and at least 30G of disk space free.  The instructions assume you are capable of using the command line, but they are not intended to require arcane deep knowledge.

kicad-mac-builder is known to work on macOS 10.15, 11, 12, and 13.  Apple Silicon support is experimental.

The documentation assumes you are using Homebrew on your Mac.  The automated builds use `./ci/src/bootstrap.sh` to install Homebrew and the kicad-mac-builder dependencies.

Depending upon which architecture you're running on and which you're building for, setting up the dependencies looks different.

Review the appropriate `bootstrap.sh` script in `ci/.  Do not use the bootstrap scripts without reviewing them--you may not want to set your machine up that way.

If you have problems, take a look at the output of `ci/src/watermark.sh`.  It should print some information about your setup 
that may be helpful for diagnosis.

Usage
=====
To get up and running the absolute fastest, use `build.py`.  It expects to be run from the directory it is in, like;

`./build.py --arch=arm64`

It builds everything and uses "reasonable" settings.  If you want something special, check `./build.py --help`, and if that doesn't help, read the rest of this documentation.  Failing that, run `cmake` and `make` by hand.  Better documentation is definitely welcomed!

By default, dependencies are built once, and unless their build directories are cleaned out, or their source is updated, they will not be built again.  The KiCad files, like the footprints, symbols, 3D models, and KiCad itself, are, by default, built from origin/master of their respective repositories or re-downloaded, ensuring you have the most up-to-date KiCad.

If you'd like to build KiCad from sources instead of from git, you can use the --kicad-source-dir option.  This can be useful for testing KiCad changes.

* `build.py --arch=arm64 --target kicad` builds KiCad and its source code dependencies, but packages nothing.  This is the same for any other CMake targets.
* `build.py --arch=arm64 --target package-kicad-nightly` creates a DMG of everything except the 3D models and docs.
* `build.py --arch=arm64 --target package-extras` creates a DMG of the 3D models.
* `build.py --arch=arm64 --target package-kicad-unified` creates a DMG of everything.
* `build.py --arch=arm64` downloads and builds everything, but does not package any DMGs.

During the build, some DMGs may be mounted and Finder may open windows while the script runs.  Unmounting or ejecting the DMGs while the script runs is likely to damage the output DMG.

The output DMGs from `build.py` go into `dmg/` in the build directory.  Both the build directory and dmg directory can be specified at the command line.

KiCad Mac Builder does not install KiCad onto your Mac or modify your currently installed KiCad.

Apple Silicon
=============
Intel builds of KiCad work great on Apple Silicon.  Native Apple Silicon KiCad builds are experimental.

On an Apple Silicon system, you'll need to specify `--arch arm64` to `build.py`.  You'll also need arm64 versions of the dependencies.

If you only have a Homebrew in /opt/homebrew, you're probably already OK.

If you have Homebrew installed in /usr/local, it's probably a Rosetta version of Homebrew which installs x86_64 versions of things on your arm64 system.  You will need to install Homebrew natively into /opt/homebrew for arm64 build to succeed.

If you have both installed, make sure that /opt/homebrew/bin is before the /usr/local Homebrew location in your PATH.

See the scripts inside ci/.

If you are trying to build for x86_64 on arm64, you'll need to install a Rosetta 2 Homebrew (which typically ends up in /usr/local/).  Make sure that /usr/local/bin is before /opt/homebrew/bin in your PATH, and prefix the build.py command with `arch -x86_64`.  For instance:

`PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH arch -x86_64 ./build.py --arch=x86_64`

The Apple Silicon build support is experimental, and we'd love to hear how it's gone for you.  Your feedback will help us stop flagging this whole section as experimental! :)

Signing and Notarization
========================
By default, kicad-mac-builder will sign KiCad with an ad-hoc signature, which does not require any setup or configuration.  Your ad-hoc signed KiCad should run fine on your system, but cannot be notarized by Apple.  When Mac applications are ad-hoc signed, they do not support Hardened Runtime, which provides extra security protection.

kicad-mac-builder supports "real" signing of build outputs.  kicad-mac-builder expects you are using a Developer ID certificate.  Details on creating one are available at https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/.

kicad-mac-builder used to help with notarization by wrapping `xcrun altool`.  As of November 2023, this has been removed due to the improved ergonomics of `xcrun notarytool`.  If you were using the apple.py notarize helper before, try something akin to the following:

```
echo "Submitting to Apple for notarization at $(date)"
xcrun notarytool submit --apple-id "${APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID}" \
                        --team-id "${APPLE_TEAM_ID}" \
                        --password "${APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD}" \
                        --wait \
                        "$DMG"
echo "Notarization finished at $(date)"
echo "Stapling notarization ticket to disk image"
xcrun stapler staple "$DMG"
echo "Validating notarization ticket"
xcrun stapler validate "$DMG"
echo "Validation complete at $(date)"
```

Template DMG
============
Sometimes, the template DMG needs to be manually enlarged.  This will manifest with errors enlarging the DMG.

A new template DMG can be generated with the script in `dmgbuild/`.

Setting up a KiCad Build Environment
====================================

You can use kicad-mac-builder to set up a KiCad build environment on macOS.  The `setup-kicad-dependencies` target will build all the KiCad dependencies, and then print the CMake arguments it would use against KiCad's CMake configuration.

Run `./build.py --arch=arm64 --target setup-kicad-dependencies`.  At the end, you'll see some output that starts with `CMake arguments for KiCad:`.  Save that.

Check out the KiCad source somewhere on your system.

If you're building at the command line, go into the KiCad source, and do something like the following:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake (All those arguments you copied go here, which should be a series of -DVARIABLENAME=value...) ../ # don't forget that ../ at the end!
make
make install
```

## CLion
If you're using CLion, open CLion, and open the KiCad source directory.  Go into Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake, and put the copied CMake arguments (the series of -DVARIABLENAME=value -DOTHERVARIABLENAME=othervalue..) into CMake Options.

CLion will likely need to reindex the project.  Build kicad with Build > Build 'kicad' and then install it with Build > Install.

Now, you can open Finder to the location specified in `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in the CMake arguments, and you should see KiCad.app and the rest of the suite.

Built like this, KiCad should work but may not be relocatable or distributable.  There are additional steps required to be able to move the bundle or use it on a different machine.

To debug, use Run > Attach to Process.

(Developers, we'd love to hear how this went for you!)

wxPython
========
The wxPython build process is relatively involved.

If you have the DOXYGEN environment variable pointing to a doxygen binary, we tell wxpython's build to use it rather than download "an appropriate version".

We do the something similar for the WAF environment variable.  We have copied the waf file downloaded by the wxpython build process as of late October 2023 into external/.

Issues
======

Depending on if the issues are with KiCad or kicad-mac-builder, issues may be found at either https://gitlab.com/kicad/packaging/kicad-mac-builder/-/issues or https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/issues?label_name=macos.

Making changes to kicad-mac-builder
===================================

New Dependencies
----------------
You cannot assume brew uses default paths, as at least one of the build machines has multiple brew installations.  See `build.py` for examples.

Make sure you add any new dependencies to this README, as well as to the ci/ scripts.  If you don't, the builds from a clean VM will certainly fail.

Linting
-------
To prescreen your changes for style issues, install shellcheck and cmakelint and run the following from the same directory as this README:

`find . -path ./build -prune -o -name \*.sh -exec shellcheck {} \;`

`cmakelint --filter=-linelength,-readability/wonkycase kicad-mac-builder/CMakeLists.txt`

`find . -path ./build -prune -o -name \*.cmake -exec cmakelint --filter=-linelength,-readability/wonkycase {} \;`

Test Procedure
==============
Before big releases, we should check to make sure all the component pieces work.

Remove the build/ directory, and run `build.py`.  Then, rerun `build.py`, to make sure that everything works with both new and incremental builds.

Basics
------
* Open up KiCad.app, and then open up each of the applications like Pcbnew and the calculator.
* Open up each of the apps in standalone mode.

Templates
---------
* Open up KiCad.app, and click File -> New -> Project from Template.  You should see a new window pop up with options like STM32 and Raspberry Pi.  Select one, and click OK.  It will ask you where to save.  Make a new directory somewhere, and select it.  You should see no errors.

Python
------
* Open up pcbnew.app, and open up the Python scripting console.  Type `import pcbnew` and press enter.  It shouldn't show an error.  Verify that the build date of Python is the same as the build date of the package.
* Open up KiCad.app, open up pcbnew, and open up the Python scripting console. Type `import pcbnew` and press enter.  It shouldn't show an error.  Verify that the build date of Python is the same as the build date of the package. (This currently doesn't work when KiCad.app is opened via Finder.)
* Open up the terminal, and run `kicad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3`.  It shouldn't show an error.  Verify that the build date of Python is the same as the build date of the package.
* Open up the terminal, and run `cd kicad.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python*/site-packages; ../../Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pcbnew`.  It shouldn't show an error.
* Copy example_action_plugin.py into ~/Library/Preferences/kicad/5.99/scripting/plugins/.  Open Pcbnew.app. Add a label with the text '$date`  Go to Tools ⇒ External plugins. You should see Add Date on PCB.  Click it, and you should see the label change to something like '$date$ 2021-03-29'.
* Copy example_action_plugin.py into ~/Library/Preferences/kicad/5.99/scripting/plugins/.  Open KiCad.app. Create a new project.  Open Pcbnew.  Add a label with the text '$date`  Go to Tools ⇒ External plugins. You should see Add Date on PCB.  Click it, and you should see the label change to something like '$date$ 2021-03-29'.

Footprint Wizards
-----------------
* Open up Pcbnew.app, and open up the footprint editor. Click the "New Footprint Using Footprint Wizard" button. Click the "Select Wizard" button.  Select BGA.  Click OK.  Click the "Export footprint to editor" button.  You should see a footprint on the editor screen, and you should see no errors.
* Open up KiCad.app, and open up the footprint editor. Click the "New Footprint Using Footprint Wizard" button. Click the "Select Wizard" button.  Select BGA.  Click OK.  Click the "Export footprint to editor" button.  You should see a footprint on the editor screen, and you should see no errors.

Localization
------------
* Open up KiCad.app, and change the language via Preferences -> Language.  You should see the text in the menubars change.

3D Models
---------
* Open up KiCad.app, and open up demos/pic_programmer/pic_programmer.pro.  Open up Pcbnew.  Click View->3D Viewer.  A new window opens.  It should show a PCB with mostly populated components, including LEDs, sockets, resistors, and capacitors.  At least one connector appears to be missing.
* Open up Pcbnew.app, and open up demos/pic_programmer/pic_programmer.pro.  Click View->3D Viewer.  A new window opens.  It should show a PCB with mostly populated components, including LEDs, sockets, resistors, and capacitors.  At least one connector appears to be missing.

OCC
---
* Open up KiCad.app, and open up demos/pic_programmer/pic_programmer.pro.  Open up Pcbnew.  Click File->Export->STEP.  Click OK on the Export Step dialog.  The output should print "Info: STEP file has been created successfully.".  Currently, I see a lot of warnings but these appear to be related to models not being set up.
* Open up Pcbnew.app, and open up demos/pic_programmer/pic_programmer.kicad_pcb.  Click File->Export->STEP.  Click OK on the Export Step dialog.  The output should print "Info: STEP file has been created successfully.".  Currently, I see a lot of warnings but these appear to be related to models not being set up.

Help
----
* Open up KiCad.app, and open up the help documents via Help -> KiCad Manual and Help -> Getting Started in KiCad.  You should see a browser open with the documentation.
* Open up KiCad.app, and change the languages to something not English via Preferences -> Language.  Then open up the manual via Help -> KiCad Manual.  You should see a browser open with the documentation in the matching language.

Simulator
---------
* Open up KiCad.app, and open up demos/simulator/sallen_key/sallen_key.pro.  Open up the Schematic Editor.  Click Inspect->Simulator.  Click Run/Stop Simulation.  Click Add Signals, and select V(/lowpass).  The output should look like:
![Simulator output](/assets/simulator.png)

Tips
----
None of these tips are intended to be necessary to use kicad-mac-builder, but if you're messing around or fixing issues,
they may be helpful.

When debugging dylib stuff, the environment variables DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES and DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES_POST_LAUNCH are helpful.  For instance:

`DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=YES DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES_POST_LAUNCH=YES  /Users/wolf/KiCad/KiCad.app/Contents/Applications/pcbnew.app/Contents/MacOS/pcbnew`

If you get a `syntax error, unexpected string, expecting =`, look at which bison is being used.
