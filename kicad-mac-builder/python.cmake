# There are certain snags with building your own Python, that, while we have been able to work around them fine in the
# past, have tripped up users and new potential developers*, and I'm eager to see if using this script that starts
# from the Python.org macOS bundle and makes it relocatable helps improve things.  Of course, until there are some
# CMake improvements around bundling, we'll still have to handle a fair amount of it ourselves, but it appears that
# these changes are starting to be discussed upstream.

# If we end up wanting to build our Python from source again, I have been able to get Python 3 working like we had before
# as long as I was careful about the following:

# When you compile Python as a Framework, it wants to write into /Applications.
# The documentation implies you can get around it by building the frameworkinstallframework target, but it ends up
# pulling in frameworkinstallapps and frameworkinstallunixtools, which write into places we don't want.
# I tried overriding that with DESTDIR, and fixup_bundle got so confused it pulled in nearly an entire macOS install.
# However, a detailed reading of the source revealed that if the Framework path is set as foo/Library/Frameworks, the
# build will write into foo/Applications, not /Applications.  BINGO!
# This means it is important that PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR ends in /Library/Frameworks.

# * Remember when we had to build Python with one core, because of a race condition when building Python as a
#   Framework on macOS?  (https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/429)

# TODO: Can we add ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/python-requirements.txt as a dependency so it rebuilds here if it changes?
